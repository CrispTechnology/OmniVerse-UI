# Security Fixes for ClaraVerse

## Issues Fixed

1. **Supabase API Keys Exposure (High Severity)**
   - Removed hardcoded API keys from `supabaseClient.ts`
   - Added environment variable support
   - Removed backup file with exposed credentials
   - Added browser-side check to prevent admin client usage in browser context
   - Updated documentation and added example `.env` file

2. **PDF.js Vulnerability (High Severity)**
   - Updated `pdfjs-dist` from vulnerable version to 5.2.133
   - Fixed potential arbitrary JavaScript execution vulnerability

## Remaining Issues

1. **esbuild Vulnerability (Moderate Severity)**
   - The development server in esbuild allows websites to send any requests
   - This is only an issue in development mode, not in production builds
   - Fixing requires a breaking change to vite and related dependencies

2. **PrismJS DOM Clobbering (Moderate Severity)**
   - Upgrading the direct dependency did not fix the issue
   - The vulnerability exists in nested dependencies (refractor -> prismjs)
   - Fixing requires breaking changes to `react-syntax-highlighter`

## Recommendations for Development

1. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Run `npm audit` regularly to check for new vulnerabilities
   - Address high severity issues immediately
   - Plan for moderate issues in upcoming releases

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
   - Use environment variables for all sensitive data
   - Check `.gitignore` to ensure sensitive files are excluded

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Consider implementing a dependency update schedule
   - Use Dependabot or similar services to automate security updates
   - Test thoroughly after dependency updates, especially breaking changes

## For Production Deployments

The production builds should not be affected by the moderate severity development dependencies. However, it's good practice to resolve these issues in future updates to maintain good security hygiene.
